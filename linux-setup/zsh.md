Below is a simplified, plain-English explanation of the different Zsh files on a Mac. It’s intended for folks who aren’t deeply technical but still want to know where to put commands, aliases, or environment variables so that everything runs smoothly on their Macs.

⸻

Quick Summary
 1. .zprofile
 • When it’s used: Loaded once when you start a new Terminal session (i.e., a “login” shell).
 • Typical usage: Setting environment variables, paths, or other commands you need every time you open Terminal.
 2. .zshrc
 • When it’s used: Loaded for interactive shells, which happen after .zprofile is run.
 • Typical usage: Storing aliases (like alias ll='ls -lah'), functions, and anything else you’ll need each time you use the shell.
 3. .zshenv (Optional)
 • When it’s used: Always loaded first, even for non-interactive shells. Non-interactive shells happen when your Mac or other programs run Zsh in the background (e.g., via launchd or scripts).
 • Typical usage: If you have environment variables (like PATH, EDITOR, etc.) that need to exist for background scripts or system tasks, put them here.
 • Most people don’t need this unless they specifically need environment variables for background tasks.
 4. .zlogout (Optional)
 • When it’s used: Runs when you log out of a Terminal session.
 • Typical usage: Cleanup tasks like resetting your Terminal’s window title or removing temporary files.

Why Does macOS Make This Confusing?
 • Apple’s Terminal (by default) starts a shell that behaves like both a login shell and an interactive shell at the same time. That’s why both .zprofile and .zshrc run automatically when you open Terminal.
 • If you open a new Zsh session inside that Terminal (for example, by typing zsh again), it usually only reads .zshrc (not .zprofile), because that new shell is considered “interactive” but not a “login.”

Putting It All Together: The Order of Loading

Here’s the order Zsh reads these files when you open a fresh Terminal session:
 1. ~/.zshenv
 2. ~/.zprofile
 3. ~/.zshrc
 4. ~/.zlogin
 5. ~/.zlogout (when you end or log out of the session)

(Note: The system-wide files like /etc/zshenv also run, but most folks won’t need to edit those.)

Recommendations for Most Mac Users
 1. Use .zprofile for things that should happen once at the start of a Terminal session, like setting general environment variables (PATH) or updating your shell’s behavior in a way that only needs to happen once.
 2. Use .zshrc for:
 • Aliases (e.g., alias gs='git status')
 • Functions
 • Shell prompts (like fancy $PROMPT customizations)
 • Anything else that you always want available in any new Zsh session you open inside Terminal.
 3. Skip .zshenv unless you specifically have scripts or background jobs that need access to certain environment variables. In that case, .zshenv is read by every instance of Zsh, even ones you don’t manually start.
 4. Use .zlogout if you want to automatically clean up or run commands when you close your Terminal session (like resetting your Terminal title).

Extra Notes
 • SSH sessions behave similarly to a fresh Terminal session: they count as login + interactive, so they’ll read both .zprofile and .zshrc.
 • Test your configurations by putting something unique (like an alias) into .zprofile and .zshrc, then:
 1. Open a brand-new Terminal and see if it appears (it should).
 2. Open a new shell by typing zsh in Terminal. Notice .zprofile items might not show up now, because .zprofile is only read at the start of a login session.

If You Want More Details

For those who want a deep dive, check out the article “What should/shouldn’t go in .zshenv, .zshrc, .zlogin, .zprofile, on Unix/Linux”. It explains the historical differences between files (borrowed from Bash and Csh) and offers more insight into advanced configurations.

Bottom Line
 • .zprofile: Runs once at login; good for initial setup of your environment.
 • .zshrc: Runs for every interactive shell; great for aliases, prompts, and functions.
 • .zshenv: (Advanced) Runs every time Zsh starts, even in the background.
 • .zlogout: (Optional) Runs when you log out or close your Terminal.

For most folks on macOS, you’ll only ever need .zprofile and .zshrc for a smooth setup!
